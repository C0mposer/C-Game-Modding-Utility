Maybe implement end for codecaves that will determine size, and error checking based on linker output for that      #Implemented linker output error check formatting. Just need to implement size entry
Add Clean support, since it matters apparently lol
Simple gecko code support like gameshark writing
Maybe auto free-ram for ps2rd only?
Research N64 and Wii more
Add Rust Option? lol
GUI clean up
More gecko code research                #Eh looking not great but we will see
